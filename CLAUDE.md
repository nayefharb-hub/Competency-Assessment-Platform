# Competency Assessment Platform

Internal web tool for KIB's PMO: project managers self-assess against the IPMA ICB4
framework, the Head of PMO reviews and approves, and a dashboard shows capability
against APM role-profile targets.

## Source of truth
- `docs/design-competency-assessment-platform.md` — approved product design doc
  (problem, wedge, scale strategy, results design).
- `docs/eng-plan-competency-assessment-platform.md` — engineering build plan
  (stack, data model, state machine, task order T0–T10).
- `DESIGN.md` — the visual design system.

## Design System
Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decisions.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

## Stack
Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) · Supabase (Postgres + Auth) · Vercel · Recharts.
All database access goes through server-side code (service key server-side only);
the client never holds a table-capable key.

## Domain rules that must not drift
- Framework: IPMA ICB4 v4.0.1 — 3 areas, 28 competence elements, **133 controls
  (132 active, 1 inactive)**. Inactive controls contribute nothing to any rollup.
- Scale: APM 0–5 Application axis — Unaware · Aware · Practised · Competent ·
  Proficient · Expert. The PM picks a **label**, never a number; numbers are stored
  underneath. Build the scale as a swappable module (a PDCF variant may be added later).
- Scores: `self_level` (PM) and `assessor_level` (authoritative, shows in results).
  The assessor reviews and revises — accept as-is or override specific controls.
- Targets come from the selected APM benchmark profile (default Intermediate).
  Targets are **not** rolled up or averaged; they are published values.
- Rollup per competence element: **mean of assessor scores across active controls**,
  with the **weakest control** shown alongside.
- Health: Role Ready (at/above target) · Minor Gap (within half a level below) ·
  Capability Deficit (more than half a level below, or any single control 2+ levels
  below its own target).
- ICB4 source text is **never edited**. KIB clarifications are added in their own
  field alongside it.
- The tool **supports a decision, never gates one** — no pass/fail verdicts.
- Language: never use "interest" in the financial sense (Sharia-compliant bank);
  use "profit rate" / "rate of return" / "return".
